      <h2>MoneyMax Wallet</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The sole purpose of the MoneyMax wallet functionality (later referred
          to as “MoneyMax Wallet” or “MoneyMax Wallets”) is to allow Websites
          and Services users to temporarily store their bitcoin resources as
          part of the MoneyMax Services and use these resources (in their
          entirety) for their betting and games activity via MoneyMax Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each user can only have one MoneyMax Wallet within their user account.
          If MoneyMax detects that multiple MoneyMax Wallets are used by one
          registered User (i.e. if a User is attempting to sign up from multiple
          email addresses) the User acknowledges that their MoneyMax Wallet
          funds will be suspended by MoneyMax for use within MoneyMax, effective
          immediately. You have the right to file a complaint against MoneyMax’s
          decision to suspend your funds. MoneyMax will release your funds if it
          turns out upon complaint that the suspension was unfounded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can request a withdrawal from their MoneyMax Wallet at any
          particular time point. The minimum wallet withdrawal is 1USDT. For
          security reasons (resources stored at a cold wallet), each request
          needs to be manually verified by MoneyMax Team members before the
          actual withdrawal transfer is executed. The allowed amount to be
          withdrawn from the wallet cannot exceed the confirmed balance less the
          amount of unconfirmed funds at the time of requesting withdrawal
          (in-play resources, resources with blockchain confirmation pending
          status, MoneyMax credits). Payouts from anonymous bets are made
          automatically and do not require withdrawal requests.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Withdrawal</h2>
      <p>
        While you are entitled to cancel your user account at any time, you
        acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to withdraw from the
        contract governing the bets you placed and your use of games because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          you agree to lose your right to withdrawal once the contract has been
          fully performed by the Uploader (once you placed a bet or played a
          game) and you expressly agree that the Uploader begins the performance
          of the contract before the lapse of the 3 days withdrawal period;
        </li>
        <li>
          the Uploader provides digital content which is not supplied on a
          tangible medium and you expressly consent that the Uploader begins the
          performance of the contract with you before the lapse of the 3 days
          withdrawal period;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You thereby acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Cancelling your account</h2>
      <p>
        You can request cancelation of your account at any time by contacting us
        at: <span>contact@MoneyMax888.com</span>. We will respond to your
        request within 14 working days. All the credit deposited in the MoneyMax
        Wallet will be transferred to your external wallet address provided on
        the Websites or indicated in your request to cancel the account. Your
        funds will be transferred to your external wallet within 14 working
